<h2>GitHub Repository Tree Chrome Extension Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>1. Effective Date: September 9, 2024</p>

<p>2. Introduction: This privacy policy explains how the GitHub Repository Tree Chrome Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>

<p>3. Information Collection: The Extension does not collect or store any personal information. It only accesses the current GitHub repository page you are viewing to generate the repository tree structure.</p>

<p>4. Data Usage: The Extension uses the GitHub API to fetch the repository structure of the page you are viewing. This information is used solely to generate and display the tree structure within the Extension popup.</p>

<p>5. Data Storage: The Extension does not store any data locally or remotely. All information is processed in real-time and discarded after the tree structure is displayed.</p>

<p>6. Third-Party Access: The Extension does not share any information with third parties. The only external communication is with the GitHub API to fetch repository data.</p>

<p>7. Security: While the Extension itself does not store data, it uses HTTPS for all communications with the GitHub API to ensure data in transit is encrypted.</p>

<p>8. User Rights: As no personal data is collected or stored, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete.</p>

<p>9. Policy Changes: Any future changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in an updated version of the Extension, with the new effective date listed at the top of the policy.</p>

<p>10. Contact Information: If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at [Your Contact Email].</p>
