<p>A minimalist wearable that keeps you connected to your AI agents wherever you go. The watch functions as a thin client, letting you communicate with tools like Claude Code and Codex without pulling out your phone or laptop. No heavy computing on your wrist—just a lightweight interface that handles the conversation while your agents do the work in the cloud. The result is exceptional battery life that lasts for days. Perfect for developers who want to stay in the loop with their coding assistants on the move.</p>
