<h2>Verne Quotes: Around the World in Eighty Days</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>December 2025</b></p>

<p>Here's every insight from my previous list, now paired with the <b>exact quote</b> from Verne's text that directly supports it. I've kept the same order and structure for easy reference.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXV: San Francisco and Urban Life</h3>

<p><b>Floating quays for shipping</b><br>
<em>"These quays, rising and falling with the tide, thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels."</em></p>

<p><b>Diverse population mix</b><br>
<em>"upon the side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians... while beyond appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the Celestial Empire in a toy-box."</em></p>

<p><b>Transformation from lawless outpost</b><br>
<em>"San Francisco was no longer the legendary city of 1849—a city of banditti, assassins, and incendiaries... it was now a great commercial emporium."</em></p>

<p><b>Hotel bars as free buffets</b><br>
<em>"a large bar, a sort of restaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might partake of dried beef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without taking out their purses. Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was drunk."</em></p>

<p><b>Casual gun purchases for travel</b><br>
<em>"would it not be well, before taking the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt's revolvers. He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains by the Sioux and Pawnees."</em></p>

<p><b>Violent political rallies</b><br>
<em>"The staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction... Boots and shoes went whirling through the air, and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din... It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and taking the Camerfield forces in flank."</em></p>

<p><b>Duels as honor resolution</b><br>
<em>"I will come back to America to find him... It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be treated in that way, without retaliating."</em></p>

<h3>Chapter XXVI: Transcontinental Railroad Travel</h3>

<p><b>Rapid railroad construction</b><br>
<em>"The work was at once commenced, and pursued with true American energy... The road grew, on the prairies, a mile and a half a day. A locomotive, running on the rails laid down the evening before, brought the rails to be laid on the morrow."</em></p>

<p><b>Travel time revolution</b><br>
<em>"The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed, formerly, under the most favourable conditions, at least six months. It is now accomplished in seven days."</em></p>

<p><b>Train car amenities</b><br>
<em>"It was supplied with saloon cars, balcony cars, restaurants, and smoking-cars... The backs of the seats were thrown back, bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out... each traveller had soon at his disposition a comfortable bed, protected from curious eyes by thick curtains."</em></p>

<p><b>Buffalo herds blocking trains</b><br>
<em>"a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track... The procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours... it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain."</em></p>

<p><b>Route and terrain</b><br>
<em>"territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts... plunges into the Tuilla Valley, across the American Desert, Cedar and Humboldt Mountains, the Sierra Nevada... its grade, even on the Rocky Mountains, never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile."</em></p>

<h3>Chapter XXVII: Mormonism and Utah</h3>

<p><b>Mormon polygamy as norm</b><br>
<em>"thanks to the polygamy practised by the Mormons, had flourished beyond expectations... it is mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as, according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to the possession of its highest joys."</em></p>

<p><b>Persecution and expansion</b><br>
<em>"Driven from Vermont, driven from Illinois, driven from Ohio, driven from Missouri, driven from Utah, we shall yet find some independent territory... Why has Brigham Young, our chief, been imprisoned, in contempt of all justice?"</em></p>

<p><b>Salt Lake City layout</b><br>
<em>"built on the pattern of other cities of the Union, like a checker-board, 'with the sombre sadness of right-angles'... the prophet's mansion, the court-house, and the arsenal... a clay and pebble wall, built in 1853, surrounded the town."</em></p>

<p><b>Missionary lectures on trains</b><br>
<em>"Elder William Hitch, Mormon missionary... would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No. 117... he invited all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the religion of the 'Latter Day Saints' to attend."</em></p>

<h3>Chapter XXVIII: Rocky Mountains and Risks</h3>

<p><b>Government subsidies for tough terrain</b><br>
<em>"the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile, instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains."</em></p>

<p><b>Risky bridge crossing</b><br>
<em>"by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over... the train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, hardly bore upon the rails at all... scarcely had the train passed the river, when the bridge, completely ruined, fell with a crash."</em></p>

<h3>Chapter XXIX: Plains and Conflicts</h3>

<p><b>Sioux train attacks</b><br>
<em>"A hundred of them had, according to their habit, jumped upon the steps without stopping the train... The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs... fighting hand to hand with the passengers."</em></p>

<p><b>Duels on trains</b><br>
<em>"The car, which was some fifty feet long, was very convenient for their purpose. The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle, and fire at their ease. Never was duel more easily arranged."</em></p>

<p><b>Inauguration festivities</b><br>
<em>"Two powerful locomotives... stopped at this point; cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle, fireworks were let off, and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train."</em></p>

<h3>Chapter XXX: Aftermath and Rescue</h3>

<p><b>Volunteer rescues from forts</b><br>
<em>"Thirty volunteers!' he added, turning to the soldiers... 'My friends, I will divide five thousand dollars among you, if we save the prisoners.'"</em></p>

<p><b>Detached locomotive returns</b><br>
<em>"The locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles, was that which, having been detached from the train, had continued its route... the locomotive returned, running backwards to Fort Kearney."</em></p>

<p><b>Delayed trains as fatal</b><br>
<em>"We are already three hours behind time.'... 'And when will another train pass here from San Francisco?' 'To-morrow evening, madam.' 'To-morrow evening! But then it will be too late!'"</em></p>
