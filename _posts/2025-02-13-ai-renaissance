<h2>An AI Renaissance</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>February 2025</b></p>

<p>We don't want an AI revolution we want an AI renaissance.</p>

<p>Today, we seem headed for an AI revolution—a chaotic upheaval, much like the French Revolution. While transformative, such a path is violent, and will tear apart the fabric of society.</p>

<p>An AI Renaissance, however, offers a different vision—one of cultural rebirth. It revives timeless values rooted in wisdom, beauty, and human flourishing. AI, as a powerful tool, can help us build this future—one where technology enhances civilization rather than fractures it.</p>

<p>Imagine America adorned with cities as breathtaking as Paris and Florence. Energy, abundant and clean, flows from nuclear and renewables. High-speed rail seamlessly connects LA to San Fran and Dallas to Houston. Social media that helps build genuine communities instead of isolating individuals.</p>

<p>We need to build towards an AI renaissance.  It starts with restoring good values and leaders who have those values and it starts with getting real about whether you're building AI to build more AI or if you're making a tool that can have a real life impact and make the world more beautiful, more wise and solve real human problems.</p>
