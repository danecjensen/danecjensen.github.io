<h2>Small Parisian Table</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>January 2025</b></p>

<p>
  She loved small Parisian cafe tables. She loved how they would fill up with food until there was no space left. 
  You loved common cliche things like being in Paris, being in love, smoking cigarettes when you felt melacholy, making love, 
  fucking, eating steak and frites, yourself, thinking about the things you loved. Thinking about what her underwear looked 
  like laid across the bed that morning when she was off in the other room and you had all the time to appreciate it 
  in the morning sunlight. You memorized the underwear that morning just like the night before lying next to her you memorized her face. 
  You thought if there was one thing your brain could get right it would be to remember this moment and her face.  
  What did the underwear symbolize. You were taught to overthink things like this. But now you realized you didnâ€™t care. 
  Who cares what it symbolizes.  You desired it and you desired more times like this.
